## this is notes taken via learning Data Strcture Design and Analysis by Java

** I am going to introduce implementations of several very popular data structure

## array basics

- array initiation
`int[] arr = new int[10]`
  
- get length of the array
`arr.length`
 
- array with specific elements
`int[] arr = new int[]{1,2,3}`
  
- retrieve value from the array
`for loop`
  `for(int element : arr)`
  
- capacity of an array, max number it could contain

- to comment some lines
`/******
  */`
- code block: if the in the `{}` there is only one line,
you do skip the {}. like 
  `for (int x : arr)
      x++; `
  
- placeholder `%d`
